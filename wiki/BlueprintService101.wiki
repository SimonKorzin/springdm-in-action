#summary Tutorial for Spring DM Blueprint Reference Implementation

= Introduction =

The [http://www.osgi.org OSGi] Blueprint Service aims at instantiating, configuring and assembling the inner components of an OSGi bundle. It also allows interacting with the OSGi service registry (register/consume services) in a declarative way.

The Blueprint Service (a.k.a RFC-124) has been introduced in the 4.2 version of the OSGi specifiation and is a standardization of [http://www.springsource.org/osgi/ Spring DM]. So, think of the Blueprint Service as a component model for the inner assembling of OSGi bundles and a tool to publish/consume OSGi services in a reliable way, without having to use the OSGi API at all.

This page is a tutorial to introduce the Reference Implementation of the Blueprint Service, Spring DM 2.0. You'll learn how to associate a Blueprint Container to an OSGi bundle. This container will contain a simple bean, which will be registered declaratively on the service registry.

Prerequisites:
  * basic understanding of OSGi
  * Maven 2 installed

= Creating the bundle =

In a working directory, create a Maven 2 project with the following command:

{{{
mvn archetype:generate
}}}

You'll be prompted for several choices:
  * archetype to use: choose the default (15, a basic Maven 2 project), just type {{{Enter}}}
  * the group of the project: {{{com.manning.sdmia}}}
  * the artifact id: {{{blueprint101}}}
  * the defaut package: default, just type {{{Enter}}}
  * the version: default, just type {{{Enter}}}
  * confirmation: type {{{Enter}}}

This creates
